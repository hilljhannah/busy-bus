# busy-bus is a live prototype for a concept public transit app designed and coded by me.

[Original Mockup - Clean but didnt provide the user with enough information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hilljhannah/busy-bus/screenshots/Busy-bus-design-prototype-1.jpg)   

First Revision - Added directional headers to sort the busses and highlight the ones out of service

Second Revision - The previous headers made the screen too crowded so I removed the boxes around the header text

Final Revision - made the text in the boxes larger and color coded the boxes of re-routed and out-of-service trains to highlight them
