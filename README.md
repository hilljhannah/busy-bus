# busy-bus is a live prototype for a concept public transit app designed and coded by me while under my apprenticeship

Design Original Mockup - Clean but didnt provide the user with enough information

Design First Revision - Added directional headers to sort the busses and highlight the ones out of service

Design Second Revision - The previous headers made the screen too crowded so I removed the boxes around the header text
(screenshots/Busy-bus-design-prototype-3.jpg)

Design Final Revision - made the text in the boxes larger and color coded the boxes of re-routed and out-of-service trains to highlight them

Final coded desgin/ prototype
